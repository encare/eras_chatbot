        "question": "What is ERAS?",
        "ground_truth": "ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) is a modern surgical care protocol that aims to help patients recover faster after surgery.",
        "model_response": "\n\nERAS\u00ae stands for Enhanced Recovery After Surgery. It is a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to perioperative care that aims to improve surgical outcomes and accelerate patient recovery. ERAS\u00ae represents a paradigm shift in how healthcare professionals manage patients before, during, and after surgery.\n\nKey aspects of ERAS\u00ae include:\n\n1. Comprehensive approach: ERAS\u00ae covers all areas of the patient's journey through the surgical process, from preoperative preparation to postoperative care.\n\n2. Evidence-based practices: ERAS\u00ae protocols replace traditional practices with best practices supported by scientific evidence.\n\n3. Multidisciplinary teamwork: ERAS\u00ae relies on collaboration among various healthcare professionals, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, dietitians, and physiotherapists.\n\n4. Patient-centered care: ERAS\u00ae emphasizes patient education and engagement throughout the surgical process.\n\n5. Standardized protocols: ERAS\u00ae provides guidelines that can be applied across different surgical specialties, helping to standardize care and improve outcomes.\n\nThe main goals of ERAS\u00ae are to reduce hospital stay, minimize complications, and promote faster recovery by addressing key factors that typically keep patients in the hospital after surgery. These factors include the need for parenteral pain management, intravenous fluids due to gut dysfunction, and limited mobility.\n\nERAS\u00ae protocols typically involve several components:\n- Preoperative optimization\n- Intraoperative care\n- Postoperative care\n- Continuous monitoring and feedback for quality improvement\n\nBy implementing ERAS\u00ae protocols, healthcare teams can work together more effectively to provide optimal care, reduce surgical stress, support physiological function, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.\n\n\n"

        "question": "How long is hospital stay after surgery?",
        "ground_truth": "The length of hospital stay varies depending on the type of surgery, but ERAS protocols typically help reduce hospital stay duration compared to traditional care.",
        "model_response": "\n\nWhile the search results don't provide specific durations for hospital stays after surgery, they do highlight that ERAS\u00ae protocols aim to reduce the length of hospital stay compared to traditional approaches. The exact duration can vary depending on the type of surgery and individual patient factors. However, ERAS\u00ae focuses on several key elements that contribute to faster recovery and shorter hospital stays:\n\n1. Early mobilization: ERAS\u00ae protocols encourage patients to be out of bed and moving as soon as possible after surgery. For example, patients are typically expected to be out of bed for 1-2 hours on the day of surgery, gradually increasing activity levels in the following days.\n\n2. Early oral nutrition: Clear fluids and normal food are often introduced within hours after surgery, which can help speed up recovery of gut function.\n\n3. Effective pain management: ERAS\u00ae emphasizes multimodal pain management strategies that reduce reliance on opioids, which can slow down recovery.\n\n4. Minimizing use of drains and catheters: For instance, bladder catheters are typically removed on the day of surgery or the day after, depending on the surgical approach.\n\n5. Preoperative optimization: Patients are better prepared for surgery, which can lead to fewer complications and faster recovery.\n\nThese interventions collectively aim to address the key factors that traditionally keep patients in the hospital after surgery, such as the need for parenteral pain management, intravenous fluids due to gut dysfunction, and limited mobility.\n\nWhile ERAS\u00ae protocols generally lead to shorter hospital stays, it's important to note that the actual length of stay will vary based on the specific surgery, individual patient factors, and how well the ERAS\u00ae protocol is implemented and followed. The focus is on safe, efficient recovery rather than on a predetermined discharge date.\n\n\n"

        "question": "When can I eat after surgery?",
        "ground_truth": "With ERAS protocols, you can usually start drinking clear liquids within hours after surgery and resume eating regular food within 24 hours, as tolerated.",
        "model_response": "\n\nAccording to ERAS\u00ae protocols, you can typically start eating much sooner after surgery than with traditional approaches. Here's what the ERAS\u00ae guidelines recommend:\n\n1. Early oral nutrition: Clear fluids and normal food can be initiated safely within hours after surgery. This is a significant change from traditional post-operative care, which often involved longer periods of fasting.\n\n2. Removal of nasogastric tubes: ERAS\u00ae recommends removing nasogastric tubes by the end of the surgical procedure. This allows for earlier resumption of oral intake.\n\n3. Clear fluids first: You will likely be offered clear fluids within hours after your surgery. This can help you stay hydrated and begin the process of resuming normal nutrition.\n\n4. Progression to normal food: Following clear fluids, you can typically progress to normal food quite quickly, often within the same day as your surgery, depending on your specific situation and how you're feeling.\n\n5. Nutritional supplements: For some patients, especially those who were malnourished before surgery or undergoing cancer treatment, oral nutritional supplements may be offered to help meet energy and protein needs in the postoperative phase.\n\nIt's important to note that while ERAS\u00ae protocols encourage early oral nutrition, the exact timing can vary based on the type of surgery you've had and your individual recovery. Your healthcare team will guide you on when it's safe to start eating and drinking, and will monitor your progress closely.\n\nRemember, early resumption of oral intake is part of the ERAS\u00ae approach to enhance recovery, reduce complications, and potentially shorten hospital stays. However, always follow the specific instructions given by your healthcare team, as they will tailor the approach to your individual needs and circumstances.\n\n\n"
